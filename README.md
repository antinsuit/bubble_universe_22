# bubble_universe_22

this file contains the problem statement, dataset and solution code base of the hypothetical bubble universe problem in national student space challenge.
this solution was submitted as part of the research case study submission that was awrded silver medal among more than 80 submissions. 

solutions_bubble_universe contains the solution the following problem statement and root_of_polynomial.py contains the code used in the solution.

problem statement: 

String theory predicts that the universe is like a bubble expanding and dying.
Assuming this hypothetical bubble universe is similar to a spherical soap bubble and
given some surface tension(T), some expansion force (dark energy), and some
retracting forces (gravity, dark matter). (15 Marks)
Repulsive Pressure( )= where is positive constant
Attractive Pressure( )= where is positive constant
A. Derive the sufficient and necessary condition such that at least one value of
Radius(r) exists where the universe is neither expanding nor contracting.
B. Given the values of constant , , and T, find the number of radii possible (only
the Cardinal Number) for each set of constants. Constants are given in the
datasheet.

C. Given the values of , , T, and Radius of the universe(R), find whether each of
the systems is either expanding, non-expanding, or contracting. By plotting a
graph, decide if any of the universes have a stable radius and locate those
points.
